                    Of the four members of the new iPhone 12 family, the base iPhone 12 might be easy to overlook. It
                    isn't a radically different size, it doesn't have the highest-end camera system, and it is perhaps
                    the most iterative in terms of updates in the new portfolio. This isn't a simple upgrade to the
                    iPhone 11 though; launching at a much higher starting price, it creates a new tier in Apple's
                    lineup. You could see it as a step up from the iPhone 12 mini, but much like there are two sizes of
                    Apple Watch, the differences between these models are more to do with personal preference than
                    capabilities. <br>
                    What's interesting is that the iPhone 12 Pro price starts Rs. 40,000 higher at Rs. 1,19,000 (which
                    is a much wider difference in India than elsewhere in the world, for reasons that Apple declined to
                    clarify when asked). The iPhone 12 Pro has a stainless steel frame rather than aluminium, twice as
                    much storage per tier, and a 2x optical telephoto camera plus a LiDAR sensor which has some
                    applications for AR and low-light photography. It's also capable of higher maximum screen
                    brightness, 60fps Dolby Vision HDR video recording, Night mode portraits, and ProRAW photo capture.
                    If none of these features matter to you, the much lower-priced iPhone 12 with exactly the same SoC,
                    battery, and other camera hardware suddenly seems like a pretty compelling alternative. <br>
                    Do keep in mind that none of the new iPhone 12 models come with a charger or headset in the box. You
                    might want to pick up a MagSafe wireless charging pad, plus one of Apple's own chargers if you don't
                    have a Type-C adapter lying around, and to get the fastest possible wireless charging. These, plus a
                    case and maybe a pair of AirPods, will all add to the price you end up paying.
                    <br>
                    We return to a completely flat front and back, as well as a flat frame running around the perimeter
                    of the iPhone 12 family. This is somewhat like the iPhone 5 ­generation, but without even bevelled
                    or chamfered edges meeting the display glass. If you choose one of the brighter colour options,
                    you'll see the metal frame around the edges of your device. That means the front and rear panels are
                    more protected, but I suspected that the frame would likely get scuffed or dented without a case,
                    and that's exactly what happened within a week of using the iPhone 12.<br>
                    The lack of rounded edges means that the iPhone 12 does feel a little less comfortable in the hand
                    and against the ear than the iPhone 11₹ 47,900 (Review). However, it is considerably smaller in all
                    dimensions, especially thickness, and also quite a bit lighter. At just 7.4mm thick and 162g, the
                    differences are immediately noticeable. If you're talking on the phone, playing games, shooting
                    video, or even just scrolling through endless feeds, the iPhone 12 is an ergonomic improvement
                    overall.
